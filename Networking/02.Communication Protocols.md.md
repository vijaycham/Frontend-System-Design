# Communication Protocols

Protocols are a set of rules that determine how data is transmitted and received over a network.  
They ensure that devices can communicate effectively and understand each other.

## Common Communication Protocols

1. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Used for transmitting web pages over the internet.  
2. **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):** A secure version of HTTP that uses encryption.  
3. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used for transferring files between computers on a network.

## HTTP

It makes a request to the server and gets a response back through the TCP/IP protocol.

**Example using Fetch API (JavaScript):**
```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```
Use case: Web browsing, email, file transfer, RESTful APIs.

# TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Sender                  Receiver
  | SYN ---------------->    |
  | <--------------- SYN-ACK |
  | ACK ---------------->    |
Connection established!


- **Type:** Connection-oriented protocol  
- **Handshake:** Uses a **three-way handshake** to establish a connection:
  1. Sender sends a **SYN** packet to initiate the connection.  
  2. Receiver responds with a **SYN-ACK** packet.  
  3. Sender replies with an **ACK** packet to confirm the connection.  

- **Data Transmission:**
  - Breaks data into **packets** and reassembles them at the destination.  
  - Ensures **reliable delivery** with numbered packets.  
  - The receiver **acknowledges** each packet received.  
  - Lost or corrupted packets are **retransmitted**.  

- **Flow Control & Congestion Management:**
  - Adjusts transmission rate based on receiver's capacity to prevent congestion.  

- **Key Features:**
  - Reliable and guarantees **in-order delivery** of data.  
  - Connection must be established before transmitting data.

# HTTP/3

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log("HTTP/3 GET Response:", data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

**Overview:**
  - Latest version of HTTP using **QUIC** as its transport protocol
  - Uses **UDP** instead of TCP for faster data transfer and lower latency
  - Reduces latency and improves overall web performance
  - **Header compression** reduces overhead
  - Supports **multiplexing**: multiple requests/responses over a single connection
  - More resilient to network changes (e.g., switching between Wi-Fi and cellular)
  - Provides better **network congestion control**

**Use Cases:**
  - IoT devices
  - Video streaming
  - Virtual Reality
  - Online gaming
  - Applications requiring **low latency** and **high performance**
